The thesis template presented in here can be used, modified and/or shared
freely without my permission. I have been compiled all the .tex files in
the Linux Terminal of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. This template is strongly based on the
tesis_chidisima thesis template by Dr.Oscar Barragán, that can be consulted
in its github repository [here](https://github.com/oscaribv/thesis_chida)

## Contents
* P: This directory contains the packages used in this template, as well as the
commands used. All in two files: packages.tex and commands.tex

* front: This directory contains the files that are in the first pages of the thesis
	* title_page.tex: The title page of your thesis can be easily done
	with this .tex file.
	* abstract.tex: Put the abstract here, where the '...' are. Also,
	I added the questions that any good abstract have to answer, according
	to Dr.Oscar Barragán.
	* dedicatory.tex: Put the name of that special person here <3
	* epigraphs.tex: If you are a little bit pretentious like myself 
	(just a little bit!) then you can add some epigraphs to your thesis 
	with the command \epigraph{}.

* chapters: This directory contains the files for the chapters of your thesis.
	* introduction.tex: Put the introduction here. In this file I added
	an epigraph at the beginning to show that you can add an epigraph for 
	each chapter.
	* chapters02.tex: In this file I put two citation examples.
	* conclusions.tex: Put the conclusions here.

* appendix: This directory contains a sample of an appendix.

	bibliography style.
